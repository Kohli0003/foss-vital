# Migration Summary: Hono to Express.js

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **Package Dependencies Updated**
- Removed: `hono`, `biome` 
- Added: `express`, `cors`, `@types/express`, `@types/cors`
- Simplified scripts in package.json

### 2. **Codebase Migration**
- Converted `api/index.ts` from Hono to Express.js
- Consolidated all routes into single Express app file
- Removed separate route files (`src/routes/`)
- Updated middleware to use Express equivalents

### 3. **Deployment Configuration**
- Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
- Added basic `public/index.html` for documentation
- Configured for standard Vercel Node.js runtime

### 4. **Code Cleanup**
- Removed unnecessary documentation files
- Removed biome configuration
- Cleaner project structure

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements

1. **Better Compatibility**: Express.js has wider support and more stable deployment on Vercel
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Single file for all routes, easier to debug
3. **Standard Patterns**: Uses familiar Express.js patterns that most developers know
4. **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer packages to maintain and update

## ðŸ”§ Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Deploy to Vercel
npm run deploy
```

## ðŸ“Š API Endpoints Working

All original functionality preserved:
- `/health` - System health check
- `/api/projects/:owner/:repo` - Basic project info
- `/api/projects/:owner/:repo/complete` - Project with health data  
- `/api/projects/:owner/:repo/metrics` - Detailed metrics
- `/api/health/:owner/:repo` - Project health score
- `/api/health/:owner/:repo/refresh` - Refresh cache
- `/api/health/cache/stats` - Cache statistics

The migration is complete and the Express.js version is ready for production use!
